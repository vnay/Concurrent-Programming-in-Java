•	Concurrency theory: progress guarantees, deadlock, livelock, starvation, linearizability
•	Use of threads and structured/unstructured locks in Java
•	Atomic variables and isolation
•	Optimistic concurrency and concurrent collections in Java (e.g., concurrent queues, concurrent  hashmaps)
•	Actor model in Java
